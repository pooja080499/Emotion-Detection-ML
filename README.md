Emotion Detection from Text

 Project Overview

This project is an AI/ML-based emotion detection system that analyzes textual data to classify emotions such as happiness, sadness, anger, and more. The model leverages Natural Language Processing (NLP) and Machine Learning (ML) techniques to interpret human emotions from text inputs.



Technologies Used

Python (NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn)

NLP Libraries (NeatText, NLTK, Spacy)

Machine Learning (Na√Øve Bayes, SVM, Deep Learning)

Jupyter Notebook for model development
